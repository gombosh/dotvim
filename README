This is a plugin suite for gvim.

UPDATE: tested and working for version 9.0!

developed on 7.4 but should work just the same on 8.0 and on any older version (assuming the plugin is supported).
it should also make the adjustments for DOS/UNIX automatically.
latest release only works with gvim with compiled python3 support.
for python2 support use older version.

first time use:
go to your home directory (can be found by using ":echo $HOME" from gvim).
usually for windows: C:\Users\<username> linux: /home/<username>

windows:
git clone https://github.com/gombosh/dotvim.git vimfiles
cd vimfiles
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
run the following line with admin permissions (make sure git is installed with symlink support)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode -c core.symlinks=true bundle/python-mode
vim +PlugInstall +qall (or run "PluginUpdate" from inside vim, ignore the initial errors).
reomve any _vimrc and _gvimrc files you have.
create a myvimrc file to overide/add functionality.

linux:
git clone https://github.com/gombosh/dotvim.git .vim
cd .vim
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
vim +PlugInstall +qall (or run "PluginUpdate" from inside vim, ignore the initial errors).
reomve any ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvimrc files you have.
create a ~/myvimrc file to overide/add functionality.

temp dirs (create manually):
create "gvim_tmp" directory in parallel to .vim directory (for tmp operational files)
you should monitor these directories any maybe do some cleanup once in a while.

I think in the minimum that the local "myvimrc" should contain the following line:
colorscheme torte

to update files use:
git pull

to update plugins:
PluginUpdate

yes I know, I should have a script which updates everything.

to check in use 
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

latest changes:
added vimcompletesme which is very simple and useful.
cleanup and move to vundle.

oldef changes:
- python3 support
- fixed backup dir not existing issue
- fixed fold doesn't exist issue

tagbar instead of taglist
airline changed to full path
solarise color scheme not tested

CSCOPE SUPPORT ADDED!!!!
to use it you must have the cscope executable in your "PATH".
for windows the file is a part of the repository at "vimfiles\bin" so just add it to "PATH".

Troubleshooting:
if under windows we get an error when opening vim:
`coc.nvim node is not executable`
please download node.js for windows at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
