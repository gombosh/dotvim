This is a plugin suite for gvim.
developed on 7.4 but should work just the same on 8.0 and on any older version (assuming the plugin is supported).
it should also make the adjustments for DOS/UNIX automatically.

first time use:
go to your home directory (can be found by using ":echo $HOME" from gvim).
usually for windows: C:\Users/<username> linux: /home/<username>

windows:
git clone https://github.com/gombosh/dotvim.git vimfiles
cd vimfiles
git submodule update --init --recursive
reomve any _vimrc and _gvimrc files you have.
create a myvimrc file to overide/add functionality.

linux:
git clone https://github.com/gombosh/dotvim.git .vim
cd .vim
git submodule update --init --recursive
reomve any ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvimrc files you have.
create a ~/myvimrc file to overide/add functionality.

temp dirs (create manually):
create ".backup" (for linux) "backup" (for Windows) directory in parallel to your .vim directory (for backup files).
create "gvim_tmp" directory in parallel to .vim directory (for tmp operational files)
you should monitor these directories any maybe do some cleanup once in a while.

I think in the minimum that the local "myvimrc" should contain the following line:
colorscheme torte

to update files use:
git pull

to update plugins:
git pull --recurse-submodules

to gen new plugins:
git submodule update --init --recursive

yes I know, I should have a script which updates everything.

to check in use 
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

tagbar instead of taglist
airline changed to full path
solarise color scheme not tested

CSCOPE SUPPORT ADDED!!!!
to use it you must have the cscope executable in your "PATH".
for windows the file is a part of the repository at "vimfiles\bin" so just add it to "PATH".

not needed:
find .vim/ -name "*.vim" -exec dos2unix {} \;
find .vim/ -name "*.sh" -exec dos2unix {} \;
